# PointBreakLab Website — context for future sessions

The marketing/portfolio site for PointBreakLab (pointbreaklab.com). Hosts the Whispr product page and is the public face of the project.

## Stack & deploy

- **Astro 4** + **Tailwind CSS** + **Three.js** (lazy-loaded for the hero)
- Static output (`output: 'static'` in `astro.config.mjs`)
- Hosted on **GitHub Pages** with custom domain `pointbreaklab.com`
- Repo: `https://github.com/pointbreaklab-byte/Webiste` (yes, "Webiste" — typo in repo name, harmless)
- Deploy: pushes to `main` trigger `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` → builds → uploads to Pages
- Domain registered at **Porkbun**

## Build / deploy commands

```bash
npm install      # first time
npm run dev      # local dev at localhost:4321
npm run build    # → dist/
git push         # auto-deploys via GitHub Actions
```

## Project context (don't drift on these)

- **Goal**: portfolio project to land a software engineering job (NOT a business). Solo developer, student in Würzburg, no money to spend on infra.
- **Brand**: `PointBreakLab` — one word, no space. Matches `pointbreaklab.com`. Never write "PointBreak Lab".
- **Contact email**: `mail.roshankumargupta@gmail.com` (project-facing, not the personal one).
- **License copy on website**: `Free · Personal use` (the row was hidden from the download box recently — keep it that way unless user asks to restore).
- **Whispr is proprietary**, source closed. Do NOT propose AGPL/GPL/MIT or "open source" framing on the site.
- **No commercial-licensing copy** — the user is not selling anything; "commercial license available" framing was removed.
- **No `/imprint` page** is currently linked from the footer. The draft page was deleted because the user (a) doesn't want their dorm address public, (b) doesn't have a virtual office yet, (c) is below the §5 TMG threshold for a non-commercial portfolio site. Don't restore the Imprint link until user has a real `ladungsfähige Anschrift`.
- **No "Source code available" promises** on the site — the user might open-source later, but no public commitment yet.

## Performance rules learned the hard way

- **Never use `backdrop-filter: blur()`** on scroll-fixed elements. It's the #1 cause of scroll jank on macOS — repaints every frame. The Nav uses solid `rgba(10,10,10,0.92)` instead. (Fixed 2026-05-05 after MBP 16 scroll lag report.)
- **All scroll listeners must be `{ passive: true }`** — anything else blocks the scroll thread.
- **Toggle classes only when state changes** — don't classList.add/remove on every scroll event.
- **Three.js hero** is capped at **30fps**, **30 nodes**, paused when off-screen (IntersectionObserver) and when tab is hidden (`visibilitychange`). Don't bump these back up without testing on a low-end device.
- **`prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`** is respected — single static frame, no animation loop, all transitions disabled.
- **The Three.js bundle is 468KB**. If perf becomes an issue again, replacing the hero with a CSS-only animated background (no JS) is the next move.

## DNS records at Porkbun (don't delete these)

Apex (`pointbreaklab.com`):
- `A` records → `185.199.108.153` / `.109.153` / `.110.153` / `.111.153` (GitHub Pages)
- `AAAA` records → `2606:50c0:8000::153` through `8003::153` (GitHub Pages IPv6)

`www`:
- `CNAME` → `pointbreaklab-byte.github.io` (must include `.github.io` suffix or Porkbun bounces to pixie parking)

Email forwarding (Porkbun's defaults — leave alone):
- `MX` → `fwd1.porkbun.com` (10), `fwd2.porkbun.com` (20)
- `TXT` SPF, DKIM, DMARC — keep them

GitHub Pages auto-managed (don't touch):
- `_acme-challenge.pointbreaklab.com` TXT records — these are Let's Encrypt verification

## Typical pitfalls

- **Free GitHub plan + private repo = no Pages.** Repo must stay public. The website code is just marketing markup, no Whispr app source.
- **HTTPS enforce can only be enabled after the cert is issued.** API will return 404 ("certificate does not exist yet") until Let's Encrypt has issued the cert (5–30 min after DNS verifies).
- **CNAME values must be FQDN.** Just `pointbreaklab-byte` doesn't work — needs the `.github.io`.

## Layout / sections

`src/pages/index.astro` is one long page with these sections:
- Hero (Three.js canvas)
- Apps (Whispr + Knot + ?? cards)
- Whispr (features, how-it-works, transports)
- Security (architecture details)
- Updates (roadmap cards)
- Download (APK button + download box)
- About (RG monogram + studio framing)

`src/pages/privacy.astro` is the privacy policy. Mirrors the in-app version at `securechat/lib/ui/screens/privacy_policy_screen.dart` — keep them in sync if either changes.

## What's intentionally *not* on the site

- Imprint page (see above)
- Terms of Service page (footer link exists but no page yet)
- GitHub link / "View source" buttons (closed-source)
- Enterprise / pricing / commercial license sections
